1\. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had
more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding assignment then use this as an opportunity to
explain what you would add.
  - 18 hours (3 Evenings after work)
  - If I had enough time I would:
	- Integration test
	- Dockerize
	- CI/CD Using CircleCI
	- Maybe a react app for the UI

2\. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version
of your language of choice? Please include a snippet of code that shows
how you've used it.
I did not use the [Record Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9\#record-types) too much, but I think it is one of the best and helpful features added in recent versions of C#.

3\. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Not in the production, But I tracked performance issues using Sql Profiler, and Tracing logs.
Also I have experience in optimizing TSql Queries when I was a Technical-Support engineer.

4\. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference
you have been to? What did you learn?
I haven't read the complete technical book for a while, But I try to read articles and watch tutorials in my free time. Recently I am reading articles and watch tutorials about Kubernetes and OAuth 2.

5\. What do you think about this technical assessment?
At first, I thought, it is a simple assessment, But it had a few challenges like the third-party API limitations.
The documentation was legible and clear. Also, I like the Technical Questions part.
